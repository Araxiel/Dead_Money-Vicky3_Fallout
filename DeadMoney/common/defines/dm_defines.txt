	# Pop Consolidation identifies pops so small their impact on the economy and politics is insignificant, and merges them into other pops in the same building or state.

	# WORKFORCE_RATIO_MAX_UNEMPLOYMENT_FACTOR_*: unemployed Pops with less than POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE and a Workforce:Dependent ratio that's this much worse than the ideal will be all turned into Dependents and merged back into pops in the same state

	# The tail of the define name corresponds to a Pop Consolidation Game Rule with the same name.

	# POP_MERGE_START_POP and POP_MERGE_MAX_TARGET_POP determines how high to scale the values towards the level above it.
	# For example, at Moderate Consolidation, POP_MERGE_START_POP = 50000 and POP_MERGE_MAX_TARGET_POP = 100000, and a global population of 87560 pops:
	# POP_MERGE_MAX_WORKFORCE will effectively be 45 (75% of the way from 30 to 50) and WORKFORCE_RATIO_MAX_UNEMPLOYMENT_FACTOR will effectively be 1.6244 (75% of the way from 2 to 1.5)
